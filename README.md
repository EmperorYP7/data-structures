# Custom Data Structures

This repository contains custom data structures implemented in C++17.
Although there might be no realworld use of this, but this serves as a way for me
to take a deeper dive into various data structures and concepts like
iterators and memory optimizations.

Libraries can be found in `/src/headers`.

# How to run

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Debug --target all -j 10 --
./src/test
```
